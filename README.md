# Syscall failure analyzer

## Overview

Syscall failure analyzer is a tool for root-cause analysis of syscall failures.
The tool generates a callstack of the condition that triggered the syscall
failure.

The analysis is performed by tracking of branches that were taken during the
invocation of the syscall and replaying the syscall.

## Try it out

### Prerequisites

The installation steps and prerequisites provided in this document have been
primarily tested on Ubuntu. While Ubuntu itself is based on Debian, and
therefore the instructions are expected to work on Debian-based distributions,
there might be subtle differences.

If you are using another Linux distribution or a different package manager, the
package names and installation steps may vary. In such cases, we encourage you
to contribute by documenting the steps for your specific distribution in the
[CONTRIBUTING_DCO.md](CONTRIBUTING_DCO.md) file.

Feel free to integrate this snippet into your documentation where it fits best.

1. Install `binutils` and `bcc`, which are required for
   tracing and analysis.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install binutils bpfcc-tools python3-bpfcc

   # perf is only needed for recording traces using Intel PT. If you are using a
   # custom kernel, do not install linus-tools-`uname -r` since it would fail.
   sudo apt install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-`uname -r`
   ```

2. Install `libcapstone4` or `libcapstone3`.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libcapstone4 || sudo apt install libcapstone3
   ```

3. Install the kernel debug symbols
   ```bash
   codename=$(lsb_release -c | awk  '{print $2}')
   sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list << EOF
   deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/ ${codename}      main restricted universe multiverse
   deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/ ${codename}-security main restricted universe multiverse
   deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/ ${codename}-updates  main restricted universe multiverse
   deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/ ${codename}-proposed main restricted universe multiverse
   EOF

   wget -O - http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/dbgsym-release-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install linux-image-`uname -r`-dbgsym
   ```

4. *Recommended:* Installing the Linux source code is essential for any
   meaningful analysis using syscall-failure-analyzer output. If you have access to the source code
   through a custom kernel or other means, this step can be skipped. Please note
   that while the source code is not required for syscall-failure-analyzer execution, it is necessary
   for debugging based on syscall-failure-analyzer output.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install linux-source
   tar xvf /usr/src/linux-source-$(uname -r).tar.bz2
   cd linux-source-$(uname -r)
   ```

- <u>Custom Kernels</u>:
 If you choose to build your own custom kernel, syscall-failure-analyzer will require access to
 the debug information. You can edit your `.config` file and confirm that
 `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y` is set. If it is not set, please update the settings and
 rebuild your kernel.

### Run

#### Identifying the Failing Syscall

The syscall-failure-analyzer tool requires the name or number of the failing
syscall as an argument. Typically, you would identify this failing syscall
during the development process or through debugging tools like strace. For
instance, running strace alongside your application could show system calls
that return an error. Once you identify the failing syscall, you can provide
its name or number as an argument when running syscall-failure-analyzer. This
enables the tool to specifically target and analyze that particular syscall for
failures.

#### Sudoer Requirement

This tool requires sudo permissions to access specific system features like
kcore and kallsyms. Therefore, you should run pip requirements as well as the
tool itself with sudo permissions.

#### Virtual Environment Setup

To set up and run the project, it's advisable to use a Python virtual
environment.

1. **Install python3-venv package**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-venv
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/syscall-failure-analyzer
    ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv myvenv
    ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    source myvenv/bin/activate
    ```

5. **Install Required Packages**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Create a Symbolic Link for BCC**

    ```bash
    ln -s /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/bcc myvenv/lib/$(python3 -c "import sys; print('python{}.{}'.format(sys.version_info.major, sys.version_info.minor))")/site-packages/bcc
    ```

#### Recording Syscall Failure

Before deploying or running the project, ensure the virtual environment is activated. If it's not, activate it using:

```bash
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

To record syscall failures, use the following command. This example targets the
first failure of `setregid` syscall when running Linux Test Project's `setregid03`
test:

```bash
sudo python3 ./syscall-failure-analyzer.py --kprobes --syscall=setregid -n 1 record /opt/ltp/testcases/bin/setregid03
```

> Note: Use the `--kprobes` flag for recording with kprobe points. If Intel PT is supported and you prefer to use it, omit the `--kprobes` flag.

#### Reporting Syscall Failures

After recording, generate a report using the following command:

```bash
sudo python3 ./syscall-failure-analyzer.py --syscall=setregid report
```

#### Command-line Arguments

The tool provides a variety of command-line options to customize its behavior:

- **Basic Options**
    - `-h, --help`: Show help message and exit
    - `--verbose, -v`: Enable verbose analysis info
    - `--quiet, -q`: Enable quiet mode
    - `--syscall SYSCALL, -s SYSCALL`: Specify the failing syscall number to track
    - `--occurrences OCCURRENCES, -n OCCURRENCES`: Specify occurrences to record

- **Advanced Options**
    - `--vmlinux OBJS [OBJS ...], -l OBJS [OBJS ...]`: Specify the location of the vmlinux file or other modules
    - `--path SRC_PATH, -p SRC_PATH`: Specify the path to source code
    - `--perf FileType('x'), -f FileType('x')`: Specify the location of perf
    - `--debug, -d`: Enable debug mode verbosity

For a complete list of command-line options, you can run the tool with `-h` or `--help`:

```bash
python3 ./syscall-failure-analyzer.py -h
```
